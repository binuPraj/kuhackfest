# Icon Placeholders

To create actual icons, you can use any image editor or online tool.

## Quick Icon Creation Steps:

1. Go to https://www.favicon-generator.org/ or similar tool
2. Upload an image with the 🧠 brain emoji or a custom logo
3. Generate icons in these sizes: 16x16, 48x48, 128x128
4. Save them as:
   - icon16.png
   - icon48.png
   - icon128.png
5. Place them in this `/icons/` folder

## Temporary Solution for Demo:

For hackathon purposes, you can use data URIs or emoji-based icons. The extension will work without icons, but Chrome will show a default icon.

## Color Scheme Recommendation:

- Primary: #667eea (Purple-blue)
- Secondary: #764ba2 (Deep purple)
- Accent: #10b981 (Green for success)

## Design Tips:

- Keep it simple and recognizable
- The brain emoji (🧠) is perfect for this use case
- Ensure good contrast at small sizes (16x16)
- Use rounded corners to match modern design
