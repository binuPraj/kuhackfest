                <p>Logical fallacies systematically corrode decision-making and communication. In professional settings, they distort strategic analysis, breed workplace conflict, and reward persuasive manipulation over factual merit, which cripples innovation and trust.</p>
                <p>In daily life and psychology, they make individuals susceptible to misinformation, fuel social polarization, and erode personal relationships by substituting empathy with adversarial reasoning. This undermines mental frameworks for critical thinking and collective problem-solving.</p>
                <p>Ultimately, these flawed reasoning patterns compromise societal discourse, facilitate the spread of false narratives, and prevent constructive collaboration on pressing issues, from public health to climate policy. Recognizing them is essential for individual and collective rationality.</p>
